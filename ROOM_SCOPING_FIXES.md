# Room Scoping and Event Targeting Fixes

## Overview

This document summarizes the fixes made to ensure proper room scoping and event targeting in the socket event handlers. All events now properly target the intended room and players are correctly joined to their rooms.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Incorrect Event Targeting** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: Line 601 used `io.to(socket.id).emit()` which is incorrect syntax
**Fix**: Changed to `socket.emit()` for individual socket communication

```javascript
// Before (INCORRECT)
io.to(socket.id).emit("auto_move", { ... });

// After (CORRECT)
socket.emit("auto_move", { ... });
```

### 2. **Missing Room Rejoin** ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: `reconnect_to_room` event handler didn't call `socket.join(roomId)`
**Fix**: Added `socket.join(roomId)` to ensure reconnected players are properly joined to their room

```javascript
socket.on("reconnect_to_room", ({ roomId }) => {
  // ... existing logic ...

  // Rejoin the socket to the room
  socket.join(roomId);

  io.to(roomId).emit("player_reconnected", { ... });
});
```

## Current Room Scoping Status

### ✅ **Properly Scoped Events**

#### **Room-Specific Events** (using `io.to(roomId).emit()`)

- `room_update` - Updates room state for all players in the room
- `rolling_dice` - Notifies room when dice is rolling
- `roll_dice` - Sends dice roll result to room
- `piece_move_step` - Animates piece movement in room
- `piece_killed` - Notifies room when a piece is killed
- `piece_finished` - Notifies room when a piece reaches win zone
- `auto_play` - Notifies room about auto-move actions
- `piece_moved` - Updates room about piece movement
- `game_over` - Announces game end to room
- `player_disconnected` - Notifies room about disconnected player
- `player_reconnected` - Notifies room about reconnected player

#### **Individual Socket Events** (using `socket.emit()`)

- `room_created` - Confirms room creation to host
- `error_message` - Sends error messages to specific player
- `auto_move` - Sends auto-move suggestion to specific player
- `available_games` - Sends available games list to specific player

#### **Global Events** (using `io.emit()`)

- `available_games` - Updates lobby for all connected clients

### ✅ **Proper Room Joining**

#### **Room Creation**

```javascript
socket.join(roomId); // Host joins room immediately
```

#### **Room Joining**

```javascript
socket.join(roomId); // Player joins room when joining
```

#### **Room Reconnection**

```javascript
socket.join(roomId); // Player rejoins room when reconnecting
```

### ✅ **Room Validation**

All event handlers that require a `roomId` properly validate:

1. Room exists
2. Player is in the room
3. Game state is valid
4. Player's turn (where applicable)

## Event Flow Analysis

### **Room Creation Flow**

1. `create_room` → `socket.join(roomId)` ✅
2. `socket.emit("room_created")` → Host ✅
3. `io.to(roomId).emit("room_update")` → Room ✅
4. `io.emit("available_games")` → All clients ✅

### **Room Joining Flow**

1. `join_room` → `socket.join(roomId)` ✅
2. `io.to(roomId).emit("room_update")` → Room ✅
3. `io.emit("available_games")` → All clients ✅

### **Game Play Flow**

1. `roll_dice` → `io.to(roomId).emit("rolling_dice")` ✅
2. `roll_dice` → `io.to(roomId).emit("roll_dice")` ✅
3. `move_piece` → `io.to(roomId).emit("piece_moved")` ✅

### **Disconnection Flow**

1. `disconnect` → `io.to(roomId).emit("player_disconnected")` ✅
2. Auto-move timers are room-specific ✅
3. Room cleanup is isolated ✅

### **Reconnection Flow**

1. `reconnect_to_room` → `socket.join(roomId)` ✅
2. `io.to(roomId).emit("player_reconnected")` ✅

## Security and Isolation

### **Room Isolation**

- ✅ Each room has isolated state
- ✅ Events only affect intended room
- ✅ Players can only interact with rooms they're in
- ✅ No cross-room contamination

### **Player Validation**

- ✅ All game actions validate player membership
- ✅ Turn-based actions check current player
- ✅ Disconnection/reconnection properly handled

### **Event Scoping**

- ✅ Room events use `io.to(roomId).emit()`
- ✅ Individual events use `socket.emit()`
- ✅ Global events use `io.emit()`
- ✅ No incorrect event targeting

## Testing Recommendations

### **Room Isolation Tests**

1. Create multiple rooms simultaneously
2. Verify events in one room don't affect others
3. Test disconnection/reconnection in different rooms
4. Verify auto-move logic is room-specific

### **Event Targeting Tests**

1. Verify room events only reach intended room
2. Test individual events reach correct player
3. Confirm global events reach all clients
4. Test error handling for invalid room access

### **Player Management Tests**

1. Test player joining/leaving rooms
2. Verify socket room membership
3. Test reconnection after disconnection
4. Verify turn management across rooms

## Summary

All socket event handlers now properly:

- ✅ Join players to correct rooms using `socket.join(roomId)`
- ✅ Use `io.to(roomId).emit()` for room-specific events
- ✅ Use `socket.emit()` for individual player events
- ✅ Use `io.emit()` for global lobby updates
- ✅ Validate room access and player permissions
- ✅ Maintain proper room isolation

The system now ensures that events only affect the intended room and players are correctly joined to their rooms, preventing any cross-room contamination or incorrect event targeting.
